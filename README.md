# Video Auto Prompter
This is used to show a user a video which will automatically stop and display a prompt for the user to respond (outside of the video).

## How to use
- Copy your desired video to the `content/` directory and name it `video.mp4`
- Edit the settings in `js/settings.js`
- Open index.html with a web browser (tested in Google Chrome)
